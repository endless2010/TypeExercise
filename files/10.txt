Upside down
An old man and woman were married for years even though they hated each other. When they had a confrontation, screams and yelling could be heard deep into the night. A constant statement was heard by the neighbors who feared   the man the most. When I die I will dig my way up and out of the grave to come back and haunt you for the rest of your life
They believed he practiced black magic and was responsible for missing cats and dogs, and strange sounds at all hours.
