Grandpa and granddaughter were sitting talking when she asked, Did God make you, Grandpa
Yes, God made me,the grandfather answered.
A few minutes later, the little girl asked him, Did God make me too
Yes, He did, the older man answered.
For a few minutes, the little girl seemed to be studying her grandpa, as well as her own reflection in the mirror, while her grandfather wondered what was running through her mind.
At last she spoke up. "You know, Grandpa," she said, God's doing a lot better job lately.
